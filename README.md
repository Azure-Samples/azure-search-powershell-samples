# Azure Search PowerShell Samples repository

This repository contains PowerShell samples demonstrating content and service administration in Azure Search in quickstarts, tutorials, and examples. You can use the shared (free) Azure Search service to run any sample in this repository.

## Quickstart

This sample is a PowerShell script (.ps1) file used in [Quickstart: Create an Azure Search index using PowerShell and the Azure Search REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-powershell). 

### Running the quickstart
+ Open the azure-search-quickstart.ps1 file in an editor
+ Replace <YOUR-SERVICE-NAME> and <YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY> with the service and api-key details of your Azure Search service
+ Open a PowerShell console, navigate to the file location, and run the script: `.\azure-search-quickstart.ps1`
